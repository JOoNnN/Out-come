If you found out there is a hexadecimal on some webpage but you dont know you can actually manipulate it, although the answer in in number the number will represent a role in hexadecimal if not it means that the calculation is wrong.

Second, scrum framework is much more better for big project and it's also commomly used in nowadays society. Compare waterflow and scrum framework is scrum framework is much more better because if you found out a issues while procesing the process you can g back to the old step in scrum framework. As a conclusion, waterflow is good in small project and once you found out a problm you only can re-do the project but for scrum framework it's suitable for big project and you can always go back to the previous step to process.

		<br>OUTCOME 3 :Use appropriate development tools to implement web pages
		<br>
		1.Explain the importance of codes readability.
		<br>
		 <br>
		Answer:
		<br>
		<br>
		first of all nowadays in our society there are plenty of software that we can put the code on the webpage and make as a referance to some of the begineers and mostly some of the code can be read but some of the code make begineers to confused and sometimes the code guide the begineers to have a wrong concept as we can see the importance of code readbility is very important because the code you palce on the particulat software is ;ead to the whole world so everyone can see your code. if you write your code on it to let the begineers to have a better comcept but your code is very messy so this will cause that the learners think that this is the correct while he demo to others people the others leaners learn i cant imagine if every of his friend or family learn they all will learn the wrong ways it will only cause serious problem.Second of you pass your work to your teacher but the code cant be readbility this will only make teacher cant read and your teacher cant tell you where's the mistake or even hard to read it. As a conclusion code readbility is very essentail if you're a teacher but your code readbility is bad it will brings bad impacts to those leaners and begineers and they wont know whether there're learning the right ways then they show others person if one of the person become professional but he or she have the bad code readbility the employer will think that as a profressional mustn't have make this kind of mistake so the employers might not want this types of coder.

		Answer:
		<br>
		<br>
		3.Introduce one of your favourites coding guide standard.
		<br>
		 <br>
		Answer:
		<br>
		<br>
		When starting to introduce one of my favourited guide standard is consistent indentation and avoid deep nesting. For indenetation it's quite important because once your code indentation is good people now can understand easily what you type the code, second the consistent indentation in not the best choice because when you works on the others project you must follow the existing style that is used in that project, if you still used your own style it will only make the condition more messy and get confused. As a conclusion it's not that code your own style is bad but if you're working somethings that is related to other people we need to go their existing style unless you're the boss.Perhaps there isnt have such thing like the best coding style that coder must follow it's depend on the situation. For aviod deep nesting is also my favourited guide standard because if you coding line have a lot it will only make thing confused so for the sake of your code readibility you can try to reduce the lines. These are my own favourites guide standard.

It's the tools that help variety of developers a lot because normall those webpage's code is more and more so the developers dont know where is the problem that cause the process cant processing well so they can use this tools to help them debug the problem those easily.This is also the best tools that also help developer a lot.
		<br>
		<br>
		5.Explain how version control tools can solve team collaboration problems.
		<br>
		 <br>
		Answer:
		<br>
		<br>
		Version control is the most important that lots of developers or others care because if there are lots of coder work on a project but there process without version control it might cause serious problem like conflict, they dont know where the changes are, who change it, unsecured and more problems. If those developers using version control on their project they will be able to solve the collaborations because if you never using versio control while you're working on a project your mustn't code with you at the same time on the same project this cause the efficiency down and to prevent conflict problem. Second, if developers using version control system the system will be able to store the version that you make changes before in a proper ways so that developers can find the version more quickly but if they never use version control system soon they will met some problem like conflict, cconfused or even terrible. Last those developers can refer the older versions. As a conclusion if they use the version control system it will solve the collaborations problem because they now no need to wait others coder to finish code then start but to start at the same times and for sure it must have different version so the others coder can now discuss about compare two coder masterpiece which can works well then choose the better one and keep on with this as we can see conflict and confused issues solved same as team collaborations problems.
